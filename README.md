# MALWARES

What do malware means?

Malware (short for “malicious software”) is a file or code, typically delivered over a network, that infects, explores, steals or conducts virtually any behavior an attacker wants. 
And because malware comes in so many variants, there are numerous methods to infect computer systems.

4 Types of malware
Malware can go by many names. You’ve probably heard of some or all of the following common types of malware:

Virus
A virus can replicate itself and therefore spreads quickly as it attaches itself to another commonly used, legitimate program on a computer. A virus can also be transported. If the virus attaches to a music file, for instance, the virus goes with that file if it’s copied onto a disk, memory card or USB stick.

Worm
Like a virus, worms are infectious and are designed by cybercriminals to replicate themselves. Worms carry themselves in their own containers and often confine their activities to what they can accomplish inside the application that moves them. They use a computer network to spread, relying on security failures on the target computer to gain access and steal or delete data.

Botnets
These are malicious programs designed to infiltrate a computer and automatically respond to and carry out instructions received from a central command and control server. An entire network of compromised devices is known as a botnet. One of the most common uses of a botnet is to launch a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack to make a machine or an entire domain unavailable.

Ransomware
Ransomware is a type of malware that locks the data on a victim’s computer, typically by encryption. The cybercriminal behind the malware demands payment before decrypting the ransomed data and returning access to the victim. The motive for ransomware attacks is nearly always monetary.
